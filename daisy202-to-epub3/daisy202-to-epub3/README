= daisy202-to-epub3 =

This module transforms DAISY 2.02 books (including optional audio) into the ePub3 format.

To run a transformation, pass the path to the NCC-file from the DAISY 2.02 book and
the path to the output directory where the ePub3 file are to be stored into
the daisy202-to-epub3.xpl pipeline.



== Notes on possible things to do in a daisy 2.02 normalization module: ==

* Make sure that text documents have at most one SMIL timesheet referencing
  them. In practice; make sure that SMIL timesheets reference one and only
  one text document, and if they don't; split them up. Most DAISY 2.02 books
  already have this one-to-one mapping.
